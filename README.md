# CS-UY 1134: Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

Welcome to my data structure repo where I'm storing all my work on my class so far here. I may in the future leave an open link to my notes depending on whether I feel the quality of my notes is good enough to explain my design decisions.

## Navigating My Repo

I have currently consolidated many repos that used to be separate, so don't be surprised by the venv folder holding the virtual environment used to run python

### Types of Folders

- Homework: My Homework that I have done. I will not post the requirements and the score of each question but only show  the work
- Lab: Work done in lab related to coding problems. No vitamins or written work such as memory images will be uploaded.
